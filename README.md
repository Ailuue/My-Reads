# My-Reads

MyReads is my first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree. It allows you to search for books that you want to read, as well as organize books onto shelves of "Currently Reading", "Want to Read," and "Read."

## **Quickstart**

### **Install**

Clone the project and type "npm install" inside the project folder in your terminal.

### **Run**

To run the app, type "npm start" in the terminal.

### **Use**

Select the book you want to move using the green arrow. Choose the shelf you want to move it to. If you don't want the book on any of your shelves, select "None." Search for new books by clicking on the arrow in the bottom left. Type in your search term and the page will automatically load your results. Move books as desired.
